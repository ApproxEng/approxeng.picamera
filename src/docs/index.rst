Welcome to the documentation for approxeng.picamera!
====================================================

Python code to handle image processing tasks for PiWars robots

Note that this package does not specify dependencies. This is to avoid problems where, while the code can run with USB
webcams, we depend explicitly on picamera which can only be installed on the pi itself. For testing OpenCV code it's
much easier to run on something more powerful so this package should run just fine on a regular linux or OSX machine.

You will need to ensure that OpenCV and an appropriate camera driver are installed and available for the code to run.
